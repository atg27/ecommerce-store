A Short Guide to Working With Portable Game Notation (PGN) Files

The Jobava London files that you downloaded after purchasing the course are PGN files, the most widespread and easy-to-use type of chess file. A PGN file contains a series of moves, denoted by standard notation (e.g. Qe3, Rg4, h4), as well as text that accompanies these moves. PGN files are simple to open and easy to work with. There are quite a few free and quick ways that you can open the files and begin working on the course. We lay out a few options below.

1) Lichess 
Our recommended method involves Lichess.org, which has an excellent PGN reader. To upload the files into a Lichess study, you must first create or log in to your existing Lichess account. Once on the home page, navigate over to Learn on the top left, and select Study from the drop down menu. Click the Green Plus on the top right of the screen to create a new study. You may title the study however you want; make sure to change the visibility to Invite Only in order to avoid leaking the files to the general public. Then, click the blue Start button to initiate the study. To upload the files into the study, click Choose File (gray text box below the blue “Import from Chapter 1” text), navigate over to your downloads folder (or wherever downloads usually live on your computer), and double click on the file you wish to upload. Then, click the blue Create Chapter to initiate the file. Repeat the process with a new file by clicking Add a new chapter (blue plus button) on the top left. Note that uploading the Jobava London PGN file will automatically load in all of the chapters.  
Once the files are loaded in, you can navigate through the moves with the arrow keys. Variations will come up on the lower right of your screen (or middle right if you have the game database open), and can be selected with your mouse or with the forward arrow key. Shorter text can be read directly in the notation column on the right, but longer text (denoted by ellipses in the notation column) can be fully read on the bottom of your screen (see diagram below). 
If you populate each chapter with a file, you will have nine files in total, including a separate chapter entitled “all files combined.” We do not recommend working with that chapter due to its immense size; rather, you should work with each individual chapter. 

2) Chess Tempo PGN Viewer
Chess Tempo has an excellent and simple-to-use PGN viewer that can be accessed at https://chesstempo.com/pgn-viewer/. To upload a file, click the white up-arrow button on the lower left (adjacent to the yellow “load” button), and select the file you wish to upload from your downloads folder. Then, click the yellow load button to upload the file. The viewer automatically truncates large files; you will have to expand each variation manually by clicking the green plusses. 

3) Chess.com PGN Viewer
Chess.com also has a PGN reader that can be accessed at chess.com/analysis. The process is similar: click Upload File on the bottom right, select the chapter you wish to upload, and press the green Add Game(s) button to upload the file. On the top right, you will find a drop-down menu that you can use to navigate between the various sub-files. Unfortunately, the Chess.com PGN viewer is currently quite glitchy and may fail to properly render or upload all of the PGN files. 

4) Chessbase 
If you have purchased Chessbase, you can use it to open PGN files as well. On the home screen, navigate over to File -> Open -> Select the PGN database -> Open. The database icon will then permanently appear on your home screen.

5) Chessable
Our PGN files can also be uploaded to Chessable by using the "Create your Own Course" feature. You can then use all of Chessable's normal features to study the course.

Once the file is properly uploaded, your journey toward Jobava London mastery can begin! While the files are rather large, the revised version contains a vastly greater quantity of explanatory text, as well as a “basic ideas” file that gives you a bird’s eye view of the most important concepts and ideas that will recur time and again throughout the course.
Thank you so much for purchasing our Jobava London course. We wish you the best of luck in your chess endeavors!!
